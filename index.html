            <h3>Project 1: Smart Gardening Assistant</h3>
            <p>Description: This project is designed to help urban gardeners optimize plant care using IoT sensors and a web-based dashboard. The system includes soil moisture sensors, temperature monitors, and sunlight detectors that provide real-time data to a website where users can track their plants' health. Alerts are sent when water levels are low or temperatures become unsuitable. Additionally, the assistant suggests personalized care tips based on seasonal changes and plant type.</p>
